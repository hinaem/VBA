Overview of the Project

We are helping Steve's parents make a decision of if they should invest in DAQO New Energy Corportation. 
We are doing this by analysing 2017 and 2018 Stocks. 
By using what we have leaned for VBA we are changing it to make it run faster and make the code easier to read.

#Analysis 

I made arrays for ticker, tickervolume, startprice and end price. I created a loop for intead of running 3000 times, for it to find the ticker and loop once to find and give the results. The advantage of this is the coding in our VBA is much shorter and easier to read. 
It also is taking less time to run.
